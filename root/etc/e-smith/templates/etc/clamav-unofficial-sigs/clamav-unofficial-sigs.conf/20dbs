# Add or remove database file names between quote marks as needed.  To
# disable usage of any of the Sanesecurity distributed database files
# shown, remove the database file name from the quoted section below.
# To disable usage of all Sanesecurity distributed databases, comment
# all of the quoted lines below.  Only the following "low" risk define
# signature databases have been enabled by default (for additional
# information about the signature database ratings, see: 
# http://www.sanesecurity.com/clamav/databases.htm).  Finally, make
# sure that the database names are spelled correctly or you will
# experience issues when the script runs.

# Additional Sanesecruity distributed database that can be used and
# their associated potential fales-positive ratings:
#
# USE 'ONLY' ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO SIGNATURE DATABASES:
#
# INetMsg-SpamDomains-2w.ndb    : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# INetMsg-SpamDomains-2m.ndb    : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# ONE DATABASE CONTAINS THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF COLLECTED SPAM DOMAINS (2w), AND
# THE OTHER DATABASE CONTAINS THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF COLLECTED SPAM DOMAINS (2m).
#
# jurlbla.ndb                   : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# lott.ndb                      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# spam.ldb                      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# spear.ndb                     : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# scamnailer.ndb                : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# winnow.complex.patterns.ldb   : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# winnow_phish_complete.ndb     : HIGH false-positive rating
# winnow_phish_complete_url.ndb : MEDIUM false-positive rating
# winnow_spam_complete.ndb      : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# USE 'ONLY' ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO SIGNATURE DATABASES:
#
# winnow_phish_complete.ndb     : HIGH false-positive rating
# winnow_phish_complete_url.ndb : MEDIUM false-positive rating
#
# ONE CONTAINS THE COMPLETE URL PATH (MEDIUM RISK), AND THE OTHER
# CONTAINS ONLY THE URL, WITHOUT THE FULL PATH (HIGH RISK).

# Additional signature databases can be specified here in the following
# format: PROTOCOL://URL-or-IP/PATH/TO/FILE-NAME (use a trailing "/" in
# place of the "FILE-NAME" to download all files from specified location,
# but this *ONLY* works for files downloaded via rsync).  For non-rsync
# downloads, curl is used.  For download protocols supported by curl, see
# "man curl".  This also works well for locations that have many ClamAV
# servers that use 3rd party signature databases, as only one server need
# download the remote databases, and all others can update from the local
# mirror's copy.  See format examples below.  To use, remove the comments
# and examples shown and add your own sites between the quote marks.
