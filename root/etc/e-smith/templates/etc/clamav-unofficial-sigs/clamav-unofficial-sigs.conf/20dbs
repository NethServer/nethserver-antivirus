# Sanesecurity Database(s)
# ========================
# Add or remove database file names between quote marks as needed.  To
# disable usage of any of the Sanesecurity distributed database files
# shown, remove the database file name from the quoted section below.
# To disable usage of all Sanesecurity distributed databases, comment
# all of the quoted lines below.  Only databases defined as "low" risk
# have been enabled by default (for additional information about the
# database ratings, see: http://www.sanesecurity.com/clamav/databases.htm).
# Only add signature databases here that are "distributed" by Sanesecuirty
# as defined at the URL shown above.  Database distributed by others sources
# (e.g., SecuriteInfo & MalewarePatrol, can be added to other sections of
# this config file below).  Finally, make sure that the database names are
# spelled correctly or you will experience issues when the script runs
# (hint: all rsync servers will fail to download signature updates).

# Additional signature databases can be specified here in the following
# format: PROTOCOL://URL-or-IP/PATH/TO/FILE-NAME (use a trailing "/" in
# place of the "FILE-NAME" to download all files from specified location,
# but this *ONLY* works for files downloaded via rsync).  For non-rsync
# downloads, curl is used.  For download protocols supported by curl, see
# "man curl".  This also works well for locations that have many ClamAV
# servers that use 3rd party signature databases, as only one server need
# download the remote databases, and all others can update from the local
# mirror's copy.  See format examples below.  To use, remove the comments
# and examples shown and add your own sites between the quote marks.
